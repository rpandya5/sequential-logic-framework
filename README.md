  - Clock gating control
  - Asynchronous operation
  - State preservation
- D Latch Implementation
  - Level-triggered operation
  - Data input stabilization
  - Enable control
  - Clear functionality
- Master-Slave D Flip-Flop
  - Edge-triggered operation
  - Double-buffered design
  - Clock synchronization
  - Metastability prevention
